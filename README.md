In this project I try to use a Json file that have data of some supplies to sell. 

Java Script read the object in the db.json and create the Shopping Cart manipulating the DOM. 

To achieve that I install Json server in my computer. You can do the same and install Json Server with NPM. Here are the instructions how to set up https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server

How you will read in the website is necessary that don't change the name of the file db.json. 

After to do all this staff you need to use the terminal to go in the Script folder and the execute json-server --watch db.json

ABOUT THE STYLE. 

If you would like to modify to change the stylesheets you will need to install SASS. Here is the official website https://sass-lang.com/install but you can do it with the command: 
npm install -g sass . I will assume that you know use SASS or you can read the documentation. 

Also is worth to mention if you modify directly the .css files when you copile the .scss files with sass all the changes would be erased. Please not modify the .css files directly. Use Sass. 

Thank you.
