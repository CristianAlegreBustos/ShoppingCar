In this project I try to use a Json file that store data of some supplies to sell. 

Java Script read the object in the db.json and create the Shopping Cart manipulating the DOM. 

To achieve that I install Json server in my computer. You can do the same and install Json Server with NPM. Here are the instructions how to set up https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server

As you will read in the website, is necessary that don't change the name of the file db.json. 

After to do all this you need to use the terminal to go in the Script folder and the execute json-server --watch db.json

ABOUT THE STYLE. 

If you would like to modify the stylesheets you will need to install SASS. Here is the official website https://sass-lang.com/install but you can do it with the command: 
npm install -g sass . I will assume that you know use SASS or you can read the documentation. 
Please not modify the .css files directly, use Sass. 

Thank you.
